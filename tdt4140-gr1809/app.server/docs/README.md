# Server documentation

The server module has 3 packages:
 - dbmanger: contains DBManagers which communicate with the db and handles storing of all model objects.
 - resource: contains Resources which serves the REST-api endpoints, interperets requests and communicates with the db managers.
 - module: contains server modules for different logic-related tasks, such as filtering, analyzing or generating statistics.

<h3>Endpoints overview:</h3>
All data is transferred using JSON, and Jackson is used for serialization.

 - `POST    /user {User object}`: creates an user of the user object.
 - `GET     /user/{userId}`: gets the user with the userId.
 - `POST    /user/{userId} {User object}`: updates the user with the data in the user object.
 - `DELETE  /user/{userId}`: deletes the user with the userId.
 - `GET     /user/{userId}/datapoints`: gets a list of data points of the user's data points.
 - `GET     /user/{userId}/notifications`: gets a list of notifications of the user's notifications.
 - `GET     /user/{userId}/timefilters`: gets a list of time filters of the user's time filters.
 - `GET     /user/{userId}/serviceproviders`: gets a list of service providers of the service providers with access to the user.
 - `POST    /user/{userId}/serviceproviders/{serviceProviderId}`: adds the service provider with the serviceProviderId to the list of service providers with access.
 - `DELETE  /user/{userId}/serviceproviders/{serviceProviderId}`: deletes the service provider with the serviceProviderId from the list of service providers with access.

 - `POST    /datapoints/ {DataPoint object}`: creates a data point from the data point object.

 - `POST    /timefilters/ {TimeFilter object}`: creates a time filter from the time filter object.
 - `DELETE  /timefilters/{timeFilterId}`: deletes the time filter with the timeFilterId.

 - `POST    /serviceprovider/ {ServiceProvider object}`: creates a service provider from the service provider object.
 - `GET     /serviceprovider/{serviceProviderId}`: gets the service provider with the serviceProviderId.
 - `POST    /serviceprovider/{serviceProviderId} {ServiceProvider object}`: updates the service provider with the data in the service provider object.
 - `DELETE  /serviceprovider/{serviceProviderId}`: deletes the service provider with the serviceProviderId.
 - `GET     /serviceprovider/{serviceProviderId}/users`: gets a list of users of the users the service provider has access to.
